Your version of Bitfinex Honey will be affected. This change will mean that the orders you created using any version of Bitfinex Honey will continue running even if you turn off the machine running Bitfinex Honey. Previously, the DMS feature would have stopped those orders when you disconnected. If you do not want those orders to continue, you can close open orders before you disconnect Bitfinex Honey, or close them manually by logging into Bitfinex. Please plan accordingly for this change."
